## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- Throughout this project, I reinforced my skills in responsive web design and the use of utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS. 
- One of the key learnings was the effective use of Tailwind's responsive design features and handling mobile navigation with a simple JavaScript toggle.


### Continued development

- For future projects, I aim to delve deeper into the use of Tailwind CSS for building complex layouts and animations. 
- Additionally, I plan to explore more JavaScript frameworks to enhance the interactivity of my web applications.

### Useful resources

- Tailwind CSS Documentation(https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me understand the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS. I would recommend it to anyone still learning this framework.
